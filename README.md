Why did I choose these question? 
My parents were looking for a new car after out old one broke down, we needed a car despreately because both my parents worked but we couldn't find the right car. We were looking at may facotrs and didn't know which car to settle on. We struggled to find the perfect car. I think this happens a lot with people and car companies loose profit because it takes a long time for people to find the right car and sometimes they produce too many cars than they sell. If car companies had the abilty to collect data from first hand expernice, then they would be able to change their inverotry to be more favorable. Likewise, 2nd hand car dealers can also collect infromations to figure out what cars to purchase, what people are likly to buy, and figure out what cars they should push to sell. Bascially it gives car dealers (both direct dealership and second hand) to figure out what cars they need and for users to be able to find cars that fit their requirements. 

Questions that were asked: 
- What make was your previous car?
- What type of car are you looking for (SUV, Sedan, Truck, Sports , ect)?
- Which car brand do you trust the most?
- What type of transmission do you prefer (manual or autmoatic)?
- What MPG do you want the car to have?
- How much do you drive on a daily basis?
- Do you have any recommendations to change or improve this app?
- You finished all questions! (this is just to notify the user that there are no more questions)
